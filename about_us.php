      <div > <p>With increased disposable income and more modern lifestyles amongst urban and city dwellers, Cambodia’s hospitality industry has grown significantly within a very short time.  With this changing landscape, RMA Cambodia created Express Food Group (EFG) in 2005 as a sister company and has since contributed to the growth of the food and beverage market by bringing the leading international food chain franchises to the Kingdom.</p>
